# CSCI460_Final_Project_Yocto_on_Microblaze
Implementation and demonstration of the Yocto Linux distribution onto the softcore processor of an Artix-7 FPGA.

# Instructions
The Vivado design can be opened on Windows, but any modifications to the PetaLinux project must be done in Ubuntu Linux. 

Please make sure the project directory does not include any spaces, as Vivado will throw errors.
